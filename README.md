## **Nepal Aviation Infrastructure**

🇳🇵 Nepal Aviation Infrastructure Dashboard & Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview  
The Nepal Aviation Infrastructure Dashboard & Analysis project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing Nepal’s aviation facilities, including airports and heliports, to generate meaningful, data-driven insights. The project combines data cleaning, geospatial analysis, forecasting, and interactive visualization to support better understanding of aviation distribution and usage across Nepal.  
This project is designed as a portfolio-grade data analytics case study, demonstrating how raw aviation data can be transformed into actionable intelligence using Python, Power BI/Streamlit, and geospatial tools.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
-Analyze the distribution of airports and heliports across Nepal.  
-Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on aviation datasets.  
-Create segmentation features such as heliport flags and traffic categories.  
-Build interactive dashboards for exploration and decision-making.  
-Visualize aviation infrastructure using maps and charts.  
-Apply forecasting techniques to understand future aviation trends.  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
-Python (Pandas, NumPy, Prophet, Folium)  
-Power BI / Streamlit for dashboards  
-SQL for querying (if applicable)  
-Plotly & Matplotlib for visualization  
-Geospatial Mapping (Folium)  
-GitHub for version control  

## 📊 Key Features  
-KPI metrics for total airports, heliports, and passenger volume.  
-Heliport segmentation using flag-based classification.  
-Geospatial mapping of aviation facilities across Nepal.  
-Traffic category analysis (Low / Medium / High).  
-Interactive filters by region and facility type.  
-Forecasting of aviation trends using time series modelling.  

## 🗺 Dashboard Components  
-Map visualization of airports and heliports.  
-KPI cards for quick insights.  
-Bar charts for region-wise distribution.  
-Pie charts for facility type segmentation.  
-Passenger traffic analysis visuals.  
-Interactive slicers for dynamic exploration.
